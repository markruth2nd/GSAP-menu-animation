INSTRUCTUONS OF USE: when the page load, click 'SHOP' in the top left menu to activate and deactivate the dropdown menu animation.


## Introduction & Features

The purpose of this project is to create an animated drop down menu from the Navbar when the user selects the 'shop' option while getting to test new libraries, GSAP. I create an animated webpage by creating the dropdwn menu and having images and other menu options appear whilst also shrinking the cover picture.
